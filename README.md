## Features
- **No install required**: Runs on the browser using WebAssembly.

- **View textures**: View which textures are used in the map, along with their mipmaps and get a highlight of the fullbright colors.
- **Edit textures**: Rename or upload a texture replacement.
- **Custom palettes**: It's possible to upload your own palettes so you can view and edit textures appropriately regardless of the engine that you're using.
- **Adjust global light**: Experimental global lighting adjustment feature.

- **Generic BSP support**: You can also load unsupported BSP files from other games using a best-effort BSP loader which will allow you to edit the entities.

## Roadmap

- Support for BSPX
- Help menu
